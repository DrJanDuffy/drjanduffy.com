                  Las Vegas condo hotels are unique investment properties that combine ownership with hotel rental programs. If your condo hotel listing expired, you're not alone. Condo hotels face unique challenges - from explaining rental programs to marketing to investors to buyers who need to understand hotel management. Most agents don't understand condo hotels. They use generic strategies, and condo hotels expire.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Condo hotels expire for the same reasons other properties expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But condo hotels face additional challenges that most agents don't understand or address.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Condo hotels offer rental programs. Buyers need to understand how rental programs work. Most agents don't explain rental programs effectively. They don't explain income potential.

                  Condo hotels attract investors. Investors need to understand ROI, rental income, and management. Most agents don't know how to market to investors.

                  Condo hotels offer hotel amenities. Pools. Restaurants. Concierge. Room service. Most agents don't market hotel amenities effectively. They don't highlight pools. They don't showcase restaurants. They don't emphasize concierge services. I market hotel amenities effectively. I highlight pools, showcase restaurants, and emphasize concierge services that attract amenity-conscious buyers.
