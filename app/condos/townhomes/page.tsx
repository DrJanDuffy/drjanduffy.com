                  Las Vegas townhomes offer space, value, and community living in a single-family home alternative. If your townhome home didn't sell, you're not alone. Townhomes face unique challenges - from competition with single-family homes to HOA restrictions to buyers who value space and affordability. Most agents don't understand townhomes. They use generic strategies, and townhomes expire.

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-black mb-4">Why Townhomes Expire</h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Townhomes expire for the same reasons other properties expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But townhomes face additional challenges that most agents don't understand or address.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Space Marketing Challenges</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Townhomes offer space. Multiple levels. Square footage. Layout flexibility. Most agents don't market space effectively. They don't highlight multiple levels. They don't showcase square footage. They don't emphasize layout flexibility. I market space effectively.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Townhomes compete with single-family homes. Buyers compare space, value, and features. Most agents don't know how to position townhomes against single-family homes. They don't highlight advantages. They don't showcase benefits. They don't emphasize value. I know how to position townhomes competitively. I highlight advantages, showcase benefits, and emphasize value that attracts buyers seeking single-family home alternatives.
