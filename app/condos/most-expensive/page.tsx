                  Las Vegas has some of the most expensive condos in the country. Luxury high-rise condos on The Strip command premium prices. Turnberry Place, Panorama Towers, Trump International, and other luxury buildings offer condos priced from $1 million to $10 million+. If your expensive condo home didn't sell, you're not alone. Expensive condos face unique challenges - from limited buyer pool to high expectations to sophisticated marketing requirements. Most agents don't understand expensive condos. They use generic strategies, and expensive condos expire.

                  Expensive condos require sophisticated marketing. Professional photography with luxury staging. Exclusive access events. High-end advertising in luxury publications. Discerning buyer network. Most agents don't invest in this level of marketing. They use generic strategies, and expensive condos expire. I invest $5,000+ in professional media, luxury staging, and exclusive marketing that attracts high-net-worth buyers. Expensive condos sell. Fast. At top dollar.

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-black mb-4">Why Expensive Condos Expire</h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Expensive condos expire for the same reasons other condos expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But expensive condos face additional challenges that most agents don't understand or address.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Limited Buyer Pool</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Expensive condos have a limited buyer pool. High-net-worth individuals. Investors seeking premium properties. Second-home buyers wanting luxury lifestyle. Most agents don't know how to reach this limited buyer pool. They use generic advertising, and expensive condos expire. I know how to reach this limited buyer pool. I use targeted advertising, exclusive access events, and luxury marketing that attracts high-net-worth buyers.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">High Expectations</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Expensive condos attract buyers with high expectations. Luxury amenities. Exclusive access. Sophisticated design. Professional marketing. Most agents don't meet these expectations. They use generic marketing, and high-net-worth buyers look elsewhere. I meet these expectations. I use luxury marketing, highlight exclusive amenities, and attract high-net-worth buyers.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Premium Pricing Justification</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Expensive condos command premium pricing. Buyers need to understand value. Most agents don't justify premium pricing effectively. They don't explain luxury amenities. They don't showcase exclusive access. They don't highlight sophisticated design. I justify premium pricing effectively. I explain luxury amenities, showcase exclusive access, and highlight sophisticated design that attracts value-conscious luxury buyers.

                  Expensive condos attract high-net-worth buyers.

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Expensive condos require premium positioning. I position expensive condos as exclusive properties with sophisticated design, world-class amenities, and prime locations.

They use generic positioning, and expensive condos expire.
