                <h2 className="text-3xl font-black mb-4">Why Strip Condos Expire</h2>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Strip condos expire for the same reasons other condos expire - poor marketing, minimal investment, and zero follow-up. But Strip condos face additional challenges that most agents don't understand or address.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Competition from Luxury Resorts</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Strip condos compete with world-class luxury resorts. Buyers can stay at The Bellagio, The Venetian, or The Wynn. Why buy a condo? Most agents don't know how to answer this question. They don't know how to position condos against luxury resorts. I do. I highlight unique features, emphasize ownership benefits, and position condos competitively against luxury resorts.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">High HOA Fees</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Strip condos have high HOA fees. Buyers are concerned about affordability. Most agents don't address HOA fee concerns. They don't explain value. They don't justify costs. I address HOA fee concerns. I explain value. I justify costs. I show buyers why high HOA fees are worth it for luxury amenities and exclusive access.
                </p>
                <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Strict Building Restrictions</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Strip condos have strict building restrictions. Limited open houses. Restricted photography. Complex approval processes. Most agents don't know how to work within these restrictions. They try to market Strip condos like regular condos, hit restrictions, and give up. I know how to market Strip condos effectively within building restrictions. I use digital marketing, exclusive access events, and targeted advertising that doesn't violate building rules.
