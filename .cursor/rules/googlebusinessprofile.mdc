Every website page must:

- Display business name, address, and phone number (NAP) that exactly matches the Google Business Profile, including in visible text and in LocalBusiness schema markup.
- Use localized title tags, meta descriptions, and H1s referencing business type, services offered, and primary service area.
- Apply LocalBusiness schema (JSON-LD) to all site pages, reflecting GBP details such as hours and attributes.
- Show business hours, Google Map embed with pin, and clickable “Call,” “Directions,” and “View Google Reviews” buttons on relevant pages.
- For each business location, provide a dedicated page with unique NAP, GBP-matching description, hours, photos, services, and map embed.
- Integrate Google Reviews widgets or feeds wherever possible, including review schema so search results show star ratings.
- Highlight latest GBP Posts and offers on news/blog or relevant landing pages, directly or via widgets.
- Include FAQ sections using typical GBP questions and answers, also marked up with FAQ schema.
- Use localized anchor text for internal links (e.g., “Luxury homes in Summerlin”) and ensure images include location/service in alt text.
- Audit monthly for schema consistency, NAP accuracy, GBP link health, mobile friendliness, and content freshness. Immediately update pages to mirror any GBP changes.

These rules are mandatory for every page to maximize Google Business Profile support and local SEO under current 2025 guidelines.
